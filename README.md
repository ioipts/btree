# Self-Adaptive B-Tree
  
This little module will create an index file for searching with unique and non-unique key.  
The algorithm is called Self-balancing b-tree.  
It can adapt by itself to serve random data and time-series data (both ascending and descending).  
The length of the key and number of the key per node can be configured.
